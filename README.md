# Building-Management-System and Junit4 Test

A simulation of a Building Management System(BMS), consisting of floors, rooms and sensors. A BMS uses different types of
sensors to gather contextual information about the building. The four sensors used are occupancy, temperature, noise, and carbon dioxide sensors with each appropriate measurement units. The gathered data from sensors are used to determine the hazard levels, and activates a fire alarm if necessary. A simulation of time is also used to simulate time passing in the system.

**Note:** Junit4 tests are also included for the files **Floor.Java and CarbonDioxideSensor.java** which can be seen in the **test folder**. 

## Requirements

JK14 and JavaFX15


## Usage

Run the file **display/SimpleDisplay.java** to show the different informations of the building, floors, rooms, sensors. The default information of these structures have been set, however, you are free to modify them in the file to display different results.
